Definitions:

1. Convolution - A step of operations(dot product) that helps to extract feature from vectors (images) and differentiate one from other 
2. Filters/Kernels - A mask that extracts a particular features (line/gradient) form any given image  
3. Epochs - A complete cycle of computations (e.g. gradient descent)  through the entire training data 
4. 1x1 Convolution - Kernel which help to change the number of channels from K to Z 
5. 3x3 Convolution - Kernel used in feature extraction and by doing so reduces the feature dimension by 2 
6. Feature Maps - Resultant channels created by filters containing specific extracted features from previous layers 
7. Activation Function - Function that creates non-linearity in a neural network. This helps identifying complex patters 
8. Receptive Field - The number of pixels from previous layers seen by the any pixel in current layer
